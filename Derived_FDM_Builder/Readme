To Build a derived FDM from various tables

These scripts assume that you are using Primary Care and OpenCodelists to build your cohort
and that for the "other" data you are using a FDM  that is already in fdm format 

Firstly use OpenCodelists to define your list of codes to look for

Do this in CTV3 format

Save it to your downloads folder

Next Open Jupyter Notebook and create a new folder. load the full
Derived FDM Builder scripts into it and your code file 


You may need to remove the suffix -This can be done using a dos command, see below:

From your start menu type cmd
The command prompt shoudl be displayed - open this 
This should open at c:\Users\yourname\

type  dir to list the files

once you find your file type: rename yourfile.csv yourfile

type quit or click the top right to close the comand prompt.

You can now upload your file to the notebook.

Ensure that in Bigquery you create a new dataset called CB_FDM_xxxxxx <-- with whatever name you haev chosen. Make a note of this name.
