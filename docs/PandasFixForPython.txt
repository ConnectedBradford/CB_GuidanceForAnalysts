Hi All 

For those of you wanting to use Pandas. 

I’ve unsuccessfully tried to install pandas-gbq  (“pip install pandas” worked) previously and thoughts I’d have a go again today. 

“pip install pandas-gbq” came up with an inconsistency error. 

So I googled and after some digging around I found this : “pip install h5py pip install typing-extensions pip install wheel”

Ran that in a terminal and then “pip install pandas-gbq”

And it worked ! 

I hope for those of you using Python this helps  

Kind regards

John
